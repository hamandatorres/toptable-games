## 🚨 **Critical Security Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)**

### 1. ✅ Password Handling & Validation

**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Impact**: High - Critical security vulnerability RESOLVED  
**Implementation Date**: September 5, 2025  
**Current Issues**:

- No password strength requirements
- No minimum length enforced (current: any length accepted)
- No complexity requirements (uppercase, numbers, symbols)
- Dev server bypasses password validation entirely
- Passwords stored with bcrypt but no client-side validation

**Implementation Plan**:

```javascript
// Add password validation function
const validatePassword = (password) => {
	const minLength = 8;
	const hasUpperCase = /[A-Z]/.test(password);
	const hasLowerCase = /[a-z]/.test(password);
	const hasNumbers = /\d/.test(password);
	const hasSpecialChars = /[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>]/.test(password);

	return {
		isValid:
			password.length >= minLength &&
			hasUpperCase &&
			hasLowerCase &&
			hasNumbers,
		message:
			password.length < minLength
				? `Password must be at least ${minLength} characters`
				: !hasUpperCase
				? "Password must contain an uppercase letter"
				: !hasLowerCase
				? "Password must contain a lowercase letter"
				: !hasNumbers
				? "Password must contain a number"
				: "",
	};
};
