(5,$$A somewhat finicky game that absolutely clicks when people get into it. Less about racing than it is about sabotage and mind games. Full review here: https://thethoughtfulgamer.com/2017/11/26/downforce-review/$$,21,$$X1Ry7UjFFp$$),
(4,$$A better system than its sister game Descent, though I think they've retroactively changed Descent's ruleset to match it. Also I like Star Wars. Full review here: https://thethoughtfulgamer.com/2017/11/15/star-wars-imperial-assault-review/$$,21,$$inwR6DF3Lx$$),

(4,$$This small box game packs a punch in terms of playability and production. The cards are beautiful, from the art, to the quality, to the extra touch with the gold foil. The variable set-up in terms of common objectives and secret objects, as well as random starting hands, and starting card ensures that every game plays a little bit differently. There are a variety of viable strategies and the game plays very quickly; the quoted 20-30 minutes on the box may even be on the high end with many games lasting a mere 10-15 minutes with fast play.\nPlays great at all player counts but I particularly prefer the heads-up game that provides a little bit more control in the pace and card availability.$$,23,$$5tHhngRe9i$$),

(4,$$A game that can bring out some of the best pure moments of hilarity and tension in all of board gaming. Full review here: https://thethoughtfulgamer.com/2017/09/27/mysterium-review/$$,21,$$nHJNyAWsoo$$),
(2,$$I was excited about this game for two reasons. One, it was based off Fantasy Realms, a fast hand management game I really enjoy.  Two, because it's Stonemier games.   I have played about 10-15 two player games and I cannot determine what I think.  At two players many combos seem impossible, unless you use gold/orange (over and over),, and winning and losing can feel very luck based.  Even the times I won I didn't take much pride as I didn't feel I had done anything special.  The added options of fleet/helium/institution are nice, but without a strong hand will not win you the game.  This game as Fantasy Realms works well.  But this game as Red Rising I cannot decide.$$,25,$$xXxvkoOTGi$$),
(5,$$This expansion adds just enough to make the game perfect, for what it is.  I love the use of the discard pile and the cursed items.$$,25,$$r1K6XyEnMd$$),
(4,$$Bruce Glassco nailed it here.  Plenty to think about in a short period of time.  If the card don't go your way you have another chance in 10 minutes.  When playing with two players I recommend the two player variant.  The expansion makes it even better.$$,25,$$Jh1A6HVO3t$$),
