# 🎲 API Replacement Strategy for TopTable Games

## 📊 Current Situation Analysis

### What We Have

- **MockGameService**: Self-contained service with 13 high-quality board games
- **No External Dependencies**: System works completely offline
- **Advanced Search**: Comprehensive filtering and sorting capabilities
- **User Data**: Ratings, reviews, and play tracking work perfectly

### What We Lost

- **Large Game Database**: Originally had access to thousands of games
- **Real-time Updates**: No new games added automatically
- **Community Data**: Lost access to broader community ratings
- **Game Metadata**: Limited to manually curated game information

## 🚀 Recommended Strategy: Enhanced Mock Data + Future API Integration

### Phase 1: Expand Mock Database (Immediate - 1-2 weeks)

#### 1.1 **Curated Game Collection**

```typescript
// Target: 100-200 high-quality, popular board games
const expandedMockDatabase = [
	// Current 13 games +
	// Top 50 BoardGameGeek games
	// Popular family games
	// Strategy classics
	// Party games
	// Solo games
];
```

#### 1.2 **Enhanced Game Data Structure**

```typescript
interface EnhancedMockGame extends MockGame {
	bgg_id?: number; // BoardGameGeek ID for future reference
	image_url?: string; // High-resolution images
	complexity?: number; // 1-5 complexity rating
	playtime_min?: number; // Minimum playtime
	playtime_max?: number; // Maximum playtime
	designers?: string[]; // Game designers
	publishers?: string[]; // Publishers
	honors?: string[]; // Awards and honors
	expansion_for?: string; // If this is an expansion
	expansions?: string[]; // Available expansions
}
```

#### 1.3 **Data Source Strategy**

1. **BoardGameGeek Top 100**: Manual curation of most popular games
2. **Award Winners**: Spiel des Jahres, Golden Geek winners
3. **Category Leaders**: Best games in each category (strategy, family, etc.)
4. **User Requests**: Allow users to request games to be added

### Phase 2: Admin Interface for Game Management (2-3 weeks)

#### 2.1 **Admin Dashboard**

```typescript
// New admin routes and components
/admin/games/add          // Add new games manually
/admin/games/edit/:id     // Edit existing games
/admin/games/import       // Bulk import from CSV
/admin/games/requests     // User-requested games
```

#### 2.2 **Game Addition Workflow**

1. **Manual Entry Form**: Rich form for adding complete game data
2. **Image Upload**: Local image storage and management
3. **Data Validation**: Ensure consistency and quality
4. **Preview Mode**: Review before publishing

#### 2.3 **Community Features**

```typescript
interface GameRequest {
	game_name: string;
	requested_by: number; // user_id
	bgg_id?: number;
	votes: number; // Community voting
	status: "pending" | "approved" | "rejected";
	priority: number;
}
```

### Phase 3: Alternative API Integration (3-4 weeks)

#### 3.1 **BoardGameGeek XML API**

```typescript
// BGG has a free XML API (rate-limited but functional)
class BGGApiService {
	static async searchGames(query: string): Promise<BGGGame[]>;
	static async getGameDetails(bggId: number): Promise<BGGGameDetails>;
	static async getGameRatings(bggId: number): Promise<BGGRatings>;
}
```

**Pros:**

- Free and reliable
- Comprehensive game database
- Community ratings and comments
- No API key required

**Cons:**

- XML format (not JSON)
- Rate limiting (aggressive)
- No commercial use restrictions
- Requires careful caching strategy

#### 3.2 **Hybrid Approach Implementation**

```typescript
class HybridGameService {
	// Priority: Mock data first, then BGG API
	static async searchGames(query: string): Promise<Game[]> {
		const mockResults = await MockGameService.searchGames(query);

		if (mockResults.length < 10) {
			const bggResults = await BGGApiService.searchGames(query);
			return [...mockResults, ...bggResults];
		}

		return mockResults;
	}
}
```

#### 3.3 **Smart Caching Strategy**

```typescript
// Cache BGG API responses locally
interface CachedGame {
  bgg_id: number;
  cached_at: Date;
  expires_at: Date;
  game_data: BGGGameDetails;
}

// Database table for cached games
CREATE TABLE cached_games (
  bgg_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  game_data JSONB,
  cached_at TIMESTAMP,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP
);
```
